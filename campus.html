Club President</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Serif size=3>A dear friend of mine has been undergoing a dramatic change of lifestyle recently. She recently graduated from a renowned University in New York with a degree in criminal justice, after having received a four-year scholarship and intending to seek a graduate degree in 2006.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Serif size=3>All her plans came to an abrupt halt when she discovered that was she pregnant. It seemed like everything has been in a downward spiral since. Her parents soon after rejected her decision to keep the child and threw her out, withdrawing all financial and emotional support. Her longtime boyfriend supports her inconsistently, depending on the extent to which she allows him control over her day-to-day life. She has been forced to apply for public assistance and to access other services available to women in similar situations.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT face=Serif size=3>It was not until this happened that my work became real to me. Of course, I myself, have been exposed to poverty and my family has been on and off of public assistance over the years. Yet, I had never so intimately understood the challenges that poor women face in a system that is not designed to support them and their children. Enduring this crisis with her has been painful also, yet so I'm glad to report that things are getting progressively better for my friend, as her parents have accepted her back into their home. She is currently seeking a job while attending parenting classes at A <I>Woman's Concern, </I>and in the meantime she receives WIC and food stamps. She is also seeking professional help to get out of the abusive relationship she is in. However, I realize that most are not so fortunate. My friend was not completely alone because she had friends and other people to support her, but many women are and they require protection and support from the social welfare system. This system, however, is not fully equipped to handle the needs of this population sufficiently. Thus, I now understand just how important the work of Survivor's Inc. and other organizations like this one are to poor women and children who deserve to enjoy a decent and acceptable living standard.</FONT></P></FONT>
