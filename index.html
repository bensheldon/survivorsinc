        <h2>Human Rights Cities in Boston?</h2>
        <p><strong>By Dottie Stevens</strong></p>
        <p>I first heard of the Human Rights Cities concept at the Old South Church in Boston at the, Ideas and Actions, Conference on July 31, 2008 where I was asked to facilitate a workshop. I learned it was an international campaign that was already implemented in 8 other countries. Having already been working on trying to implement and enact the Universal Declaration for Human Rights for many years here I thought this was a good step forward. So along with Survivors Inc. and the ARMS Center at UMass/Boston we organized to bring this campaign to Boston.</p>
        <p>We held the conference on the campus of UMass/Boston and about 35 people attended. The response was so positive we decided that we should move ahead and create a steering committee of at least 12 people from connected interests to begin the process.</p>
        <p>The goal is to have the language of the human rights declaration to be included in all government policies as well as school curriculums. The premise being that we should all be intimately familiar with the idea of human rights as our right as human beings.</p>

<h4>Second Conference</h4>
<p>There was another interesting conference held on December 6, 2010 entitled Human Rights Cities/Modern Day Slavery.
<p>The Immokalee Worker from Florida, Cruz Salucio and Megan Cohorst from Student / Farm workers Alliance, along with The Justice Center and Survivors Inc were panelists. The workers from Fla. spoke of the injustice and violation of their rights as human beings and workers while employed by the produce companies and upcoming protests.</p>
<p>David Jefferson, from the Social Justice Coalition and Spare Change newspaper, spoke about unfair treatment of workers and low wages they are paid.</p>
<p>Dottie Stevens from Survivors Inc., Connie Chow a Human rights Activist, Diane Dujon Mass Welfare Rights Union and Lenore Pereira from the 25% Solution. spoke about the Human Rights Cities and why Boston should adopt it here. We learned that a precedent has already been set as Washington D.C. has passed a resolution to implement a Human Rights City there.</p>
<p>We are in the process of assembling a steering committee to bring this concept forward. If anyone is interested in being a part of this historic plan please get in touch with us.</p>

<p><em>Another Human Rights Cities forum is scheduled for April 2011.</em></p>
