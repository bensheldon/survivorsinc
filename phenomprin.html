    Advancing Public Higher Education:</span></b></p>
    <h2>Principles of the Public Higher Education Network of Massachusetts </h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>
    <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">(or PHENOM) (see below 
    for contact info) </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;Massachuetts 
    deserves the finest, most affordable, and most accessible public higher 
    education system in the country. We pledge to work to achieve all of these 
    goals, not to the exclusion of any of them, and call on the Commonwealth to:
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
    <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;1. Fund public higher 
    education so it can serve the Commonwealth</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    First to be cut, last to be restored, our state colleges and universities 
    are chronically under-funded by the state. In good times we gain back only a 
    portion of what was lost during budget crises. In the best of times, the 
    system has not been funded at a level for us to achieve our common goal: 
    creating one of the top systems of public higher education. The Commonwealth 
    must provide a substantial increase in year-to-year operating budgets, funds 
    to address long-deferred maintenance of buildings, and a means to ensure 
    stable state funding for public higher education. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span><b>2. 
    Made higher education affordable</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    Students have been asked to pay dramatically more to make up for the 
    deficiencies in state funding. As a result, the poor, the working class, and 
    increasingly the middle class are being squeezed out of higher education, at 
    exactly the same time that college is becoming increasingly necessary for 
    the well-being of our residents and for the economic future of the state. 
    All residents of the Commonwealth should be able to afford public higher 
    education, and all costs associated with higher education—from tuition and 
    fees to housing charges to textbook costs—should be made affordable for all. 
    In the long run, higher education should be free – just as high school is.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span><b><font size="3">3. 
    Make higher education accessible to all </font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    All our institutions of public higher education should serve the full range 
    of students in the Commonwealth; for example, neither race, class, 
    disability nor age should serve as a barrier to attending and completing 
    college. Today, high school students of color and working-class students are 
    less likely to attend and graduate from college than their white 
    middle-class peers. There should be a place for every motivated learner, 
    with a high school diploma or equivalency, in a public college or 
    university. The Commonwealth should actively provide clear pathways,&nbsp; 
    appropriate supports, and greater resources to ensure that underrepresented 
    youth and adult learners have access to, succeed in, and graduate from our 
    public institutions of higher education. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span><b>4. 
    Hire more teachers, researchers, and staff</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    Over the past decade, the number of full-time faculty and essential support 
    staff at virtually every single one of our state colleges and universities 
    has been in decline, despite a constant number of students. The steady 
    decrease in the number of full-time faculty and staff is undermining the 
    teaching, research, and economic development mission of our public higher 
    education system. An outstanding system of higher education is founded on 
    teachers and researchers who are given the compensation and resources to do 
    their best work. Our system of higher education has become dependent on a 
    contingent workforce that is poorly compensated and too often lacks basic 
    supports such as health insurance. Our public colleges and universities must 
    hire sufficient numbers of full-time research and teaching faculty, for whom 
    salaries and benefits should be competitive nationally, and improve the 
    conditions under which part-time and non-tenure-track faculty work, 
    resulting in better service for our students, our communities, and our 
    economy. As we rebuild the faculty, we must also hire the staff needed to 
    support both students and faculty. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
    <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;5. Honor and expand 
    democratic institutions of governance for public higher education</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
    Unions and governments increase the democratic capital of a community. The 
    state should respect collective bargaining by making timely salary offers 
    and honoring union contracts negotiated in good faith and agreed to by the 
    parties. Colleges and universities should respect the autonomy of campus 
    governance bodies, particularly student governments and student 
    organizations, and increase democracy on campus and throughout public higher 
    education. Changes to institutional structures should support and increase 
    the influence of the stakeholders of public higher education, and persons 
    appointed to higher education governance bodies should champion public 
    higher education. </span></p>
