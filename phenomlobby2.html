    <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">PHENOM Lobby Day, 4/25/07 – 
    Points #2 (Make Higher Education Affordable) and #3 (Hire More Teachers, 
    Researchers and Staff)</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>
    <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;Mishy Leiblum, UMass Amherst 
    Student Trustee</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;Our state 
    and federal governments have failed our institutions of public higher 
    education. As a result, our institutions have pushed costs onto our families 
    while cutting teachers, researchers and staff. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;This has 
    created a crisis in both the <b>affordability </b>and the <b>quality</b> of 
    our public colleges and universities.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">According to 
    a recent study, this year’s college freshmen are wealthier than at any point 
    in the past <b>35 years</b>, and the <b>income gap</b> is widening between 
    their families and the rest of the nation.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Access to 
    education – which is supposed to be the great <b>social equalizer</b> – is 
    instead <b>driving a wedge between the poor and the wealthy. </b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">As our 
    tuition and fees double, our federal government has shifted grants into 
    high-interest loans, while our state has cut financial aid for students in 
    public colleges.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, 
    nearly half of all of our state’s financial aid dollars in fact go to 
    students in private institutions!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, even 
    the most financially-needy students in Massachusetts are left with a annual 
    “gap” of nearly $5,000 to cover their college costs, and that is AFTER their 
    maximum family contribution, all grants, and all loans are taken into 
    account. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, many 
    students are <b>simply shut</b> out of higher education, while others are 
    using <b>unhealthy coping strategies</b> to manage this crisis in 
    affordability. We know these strategies because we are living them.</span></p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
      <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="circle">
        <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We are 
        taking on multiple jobs while in school</span></li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We are 
        “Stacking-up” on credits</span></li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We are 
        taking time off between our studies</span></li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">And we 
        are taking out excessive amounts of loan and credit card debt to stay in 
        school.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result, 
    many of us are graduating <b>DOWNWARDLY MOBILE</b>, if we are able to 
    graduate at all.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">These 
    individual coping mechanisms are unhealthy for our families, and they will 
    not solve the increasing divide between those who can afford higher 
    education, and those who cannot. We need is a bold, <b>collective</b> 
    response to this crisis, and PHENOM is our response.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Yet 
    Massachusetts students should not simply be able to afford just any college 
    education, but the highest quality of education possible.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The key to 
    best, high-quality education is to have enough fairly paid staff and 
    faculty.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Not only 
    should public higher education ultimately be free for all qualified 
    residents of Massachusetts, but also it should be of the highest possible 
    quality. Yet today, our fees are being spent on capital projects that the 
    state should be funding, instead of on the very people who make our campuses 
    run: our teachers, researchers and staff.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Across the 
    Commonwealth, our teachers and staff are over-worked and under-compensated. 
    Adjunct faculty are teaching back-breaking course loads every semester, and 
    staff are saddled with unmanageable work loads and not enough help.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Our faculty 
    and staff are overworked because our campuses have seen a decline in faculty 
    and staff, despite steady enrollments. So while the number of staff and 
    faculty decline, and their compensation does not keep up with inflation, 
    workers are doing more for less money.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">All too 
    often, the call for greater affordability is pitted against the call for 
    increasing staff and faculty, but it is a ridiculous to argue that these 
    issues are antagonistic.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The argument 
    that a gain for affordability will translate into a loss for staff, or vice 
    versa, is manipulative and short-sighted. For so long as we look at higher 
    education, or our state’s fiscal policies, as a <b>zero sum game</b>, we 
    might as well throw our state’s economic future into the <b>dust-bin.</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">There simply 
    is no <b>better investment</b> we can make than our state’s system of public 
    education. Yet it is a <b>bad investment</b> to build a system that is 
    affordable but understaffed, just as it is a <b>bad investment</b> to create 
    a well-staffed, high quality system that only the wealthy can afford.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">On the topic 
    of investment, let us look at the <b>money issue.</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The <b>G.I. 
    Bill of Rights </b>– which paid the full cost of college plus a living 
    stipend for millions of soldiers returning from WW II – returned at least 
    $6.90 in taxes and increased productivity for every dollar originally 
    invested in the program.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, 
    Massachusetts spends more on prisons than on higher education. <b>This is 
    bad public policy!</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, we 
    need substantial <b>immediate relief.</b> We need the funding gap closed, we 
    need capital bill, we need to expand the MASSGrant financial aid program. <b>
    But PHENOM stands for dramatic change.</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">But in the 
    not-too-distant future, we need a GI Bill for everybody. Ultimately, we need 
    to provide FREE public higher education for all qualified residents of 
    Massachusetts, and this education needs to be of highest possible quality. 
    And if you think free higher education is crazy, tell that to the majority 
    of industrialized nations who provide free public higher education for their 
    residents. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">PHENOM is 
    our collective response to the crises.</span></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
    And PHENOM will refuse to operate according to the belief that the <b>only 
    future</b> for higher education is one of privatization and neo-liberal 
    reform, where costs go up for students, while faculty and workers get 
    outsourced and downsized.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">While today, 
    we take this struggle to our state legislatures, this struggle will happen 
    on our campuses, in our communities and at a federal level for years to 
    come, as we continue to build toward a system of public higher education 
    that our Commonwealth and our children can truly depend on.</span></p>
