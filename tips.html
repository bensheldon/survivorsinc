They  can give you advice or representation to deal with the Department of  Transitional Assistance (welfare) or a Housing Authority. GBLS provides  either a bilingual advocate or uses interpreters to communicate with  non-English-speaking clients. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">  <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;" size="3">  Education and Training</font><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  can now count toward the TAFDC work requirement. TAFDC recipients can  count at least twelve months of education (including in an associate¹s  degree&nbsp; program, but not in a 4 year college program) and/or  training toward their work requirement. If you are already in an  education or training program that was approved by DTA before September  8, 2003, it can count toward the work requirement even if the program  takes longer than a year.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">  <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;" size="3">  Housing Search</font><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  for people in emergency shelter also counts toward the work  requirement. For families who are in shelter, DTA must treat them as in  full compliance with the work requirement as long as they are in  compliance with any EA or shelter housing search requirements,  regardless of how many hours of housing search they are doing</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">  <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  DTA is not supposed to lower or stop your benefits for not meeting the  work requirement&nbsp; (or the terms of your Employment Development  Plan) if you have "good&nbsp; cause" such as:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o lack appropriate and available child care; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o lack affordable and reliable transportation;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o need to do housing search;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o lack an available and appropriate community service site identified by DTA;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o have a family member who has an illness or disability;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o need to care for a family member who has an illness or disability;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o have a family crisis, an emergency or other compelling circumstance beyond your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp; control that you must attend during hours you would otherwise be doing required&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp; activities;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  o have a job or were offered a job that: violated minimum wage laws;  discriminated on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, ethnic origin,  or physical or mental disability; violated health and safety standards;  or was available due to a strike or lockout.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; DTA is not supposed to lower or stop your benefits without  first reviewing all the above good cause reasons with the family to see  if any apply. If you think DTA made a mistake in reducing or taking  away your benefits, quickly file an appeal and contact your local Legal  Services Office for help.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">  <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;" size="3">Get money back from Earned Income Tax Credit</font><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  Many people don¹t know that they can get money back from the  government. Workers with more than one child in 2003 who had a family  income of less than $33,692&nbsp; (or $34,692 for married workers) can  get up to $4,204. Workers who were raising one child in their home in  2003 and had a family income of less than $29,666 (or $30,666 for  married workers) $2,547. Workers&nbsp; who are not raising children in  their home, were between ages 25 and 64 on December 31, 2003, and had  income below $11,230 (or $12,230 for married workers), can get up to  $382.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to get an estimate of how much you might  be entitled to get back, go to the EITC web site at  http://www.cbpp.org/eic2004/index.html</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; You can get EITC Advance Payments in your paychecks. To  get EIC Advance payments, give a W-5 form to your employer. You can get  the W-5 from your employer, or by calling the IRS at 1-800-TAX-FORM  (1-800-829-3676). If you have a checking account, you can have your  EITC refund deposited directly. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people pay money to a private  tax company like H&amp;R Block to get help in filing their tax form or  to get the money right away. Rather than do that, try to get free  advice. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) is a free, IRS-sponsored  program to help low-income workers fill out their tax forms. To find  the location of a VITA site near you, call 1-800-829-1040. Ask for the  procedures department.<br>  &nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;" size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;  If you live in Boston, you can get free help in applying for the EITC</font><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  and free financial counseling.&nbsp; Call 617-918-5275 or visit  www.bostontaxhelp.org </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; A family¹s earned income tax credit payments do not count  as income in determining eligibility or benefit levels for TAFDC,  Medicaid, food stamps, SSI, work experience activities (such as  community service), or public housing. Work-study students can file for  EITC.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; To figure your EITC, use a special worksheet included as  part of the EITC instructions in form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ.&nbsp;  Instructions in these forms require some taxpayers to use a worksheet  in Publication 596 instead of the worksheet in the tax package.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">  <font style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;" size="3"><br>  <font size="3">  Massachusetts worker </font></font><font style="font-family: sans-serif;" size="2">get an</font><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">  extra&nbsp; state credit worth 15% of their federal credit.

The  "self-sufficiency standard" that Wider Opportunities for Women  developed to show how much it really costs to live in Boston said that  a 3-person family needed to earn over $51,284 in 2003 in order to meet  expenses.
