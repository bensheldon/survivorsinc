    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 3.0pt" align="left"><font size="5">Save Our 
    School! </font></h4>
    <p class="MsoBodyText">Join the campaign to save CPCS and press lawmakers to 
    support public higher education in Massachusetts!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Poor women 
    face constant challenges to our ability to remain in school.&nbsp; Pursuing 
    degrees—often on top of some waged work, unpaid caregiving&nbsp; as single 
    mothers, mandatory community service, and other personal challenges—we&nbsp; 
    mothers are pulling off miracles!&nbsp; Few campuses provide the infrastructure 
    to support us. One of the premiere programs that does support us and other 
    nontraditional students is the College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) 
    at UMass Boston, where Survivors Inc. has been organizing for years. Now 
    CPCS is under attack.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We view CPCS 
    as the canary in the coal mine. If they are able to dismantle CPCS, or to 
    turn it away from its urban mission, next they will go after other programs 
    in the public university system. Recently Survivors Inc. has joined the 
    Public Higher Education Network of Massachusetts. See PHENOM’s principles, 
    our Legislative Priorities, and a description of our recent Lobby Day on 
    this website. Please join us in the campaign to save CPCS and make higher 
    education accessible for ALL residents in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 
    opening its doors in 1973, CPCS has provided a center and a beacon for the 
    University to honor its urban mission.&nbsp; Affordability, outreach to students 
    who would not otherwise have access to college (low-income people, people of 
    color, immigrants and other excluded groups), robust student support 
    services, and competency-based learning have all made CPCS what it is.&nbsp; More 
    than an academic college, CPCS has served as an activist training base. In 
    fact, CPCS was the birthplace of our own Survivors, Inc. and several of our 
    leaders are alumnae of the program.&nbsp; Graduates include many who continue to 
    fight courageously and effectively for social and economic justice.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">University 
    administration has mounted several efforts over the years to shut CPCS down.<span style="color: #3366FF">&nbsp;
    </span>They view the program as radical, unprofitable and standing in the 
    way of UMass’s ambitions to court a more affluent clientele.&nbsp; In the past, 
    student, faculty, and alumni mobilizations have been successful at keeping 
    the school open. However, the current attempt to close the school is the 
    most serious threat yet. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Over the 
    past several years, new University administration has cut CPCS’s budget by 
    24%, failed to replace the nearly 30% of full time faculty lost to early 
    retirement, cut other staff positions by 14%, and cut curriculum offerings 
    by 30%. New centralized admission policies, imposing traditional admissions 
    standard (e.g. high SAT scores) blocks CPCS from doing its own highly 
    effective recruitment of nontraditional students. Decreased enrollment 
    becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and a justification for closing the 
    school.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no 
    longer a possibility of a dignified survival for low-income women through 
    the welfare system. Meaningful work for a living wage is far out of reach 
    for many of us. Education is our bridge to supporting ourselves and our 
    families and nourishing our minds and spirits as well as our bodies. Now 
    those in power are trying to destroy that bridge. Many of us with Survivors, 
    Inc. have crossed that bridge ourselves. We will fight as hard and as smart 
    as we can to make sure that the opportunities for higher education remain 
    intact for our low-income sisters and brothers who come after us.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We must stop 
    the attacks. Please join us in the struggle to save CPCS and support 
    high-quality and accessible public higher education for all. Get involved. 
    Call us!</span><hr>
