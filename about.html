<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT face=Serif><STRONG style="FONT-FAMILY: serif"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: serif"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>&nbsp;I have a meeting with a caseworker this Monday.&nbsp; I have decided I will not tolerate any more disrespect, I will march in there like I would for a job interview, act confident and, perhaps with them, slightly haughty.&nbsp; I believe that like feral animals, they smell fear and people in my situation have much fear.&nbsp; And to show fear is to show weakness and so they pounce!&nbsp; Why not disrespect this poor, frightened person who has no power or motivation to complain.</FONT></DIV>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>So many people are living on the edge financially that it takes one major disaster like job loss or illness [or hurricane (eds.)]&nbsp;to change a "have" into a "have not" and it is a humbling experience.&nbsp; I think I will bring my resume to my appointment because&nbsp;I just filled out the application that asks several times very snottily, "why don't you have a job, what are you doing to get one, and how will you support your family when this assistance runs out?"&nbsp; I will show her the resume and say, "See, I am an intelligent human being down on her luck, but not down on her pride!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Lisa Sharp</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>Dear Survivors,</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>In my desperate search to find housing, I just came across your website.&nbsp; As I live in a relatively affluent (compared to my circumstances) community, it is very rare to come across any reference to poor people and the problems of homelessness and lack of food and adequate healthcare.</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>The house I have been living in for almost six years is being sold and I and my five youngest children are being evicted.&nbsp; We cannot possibly afford to rent, there are no more subsidies and we have no place to go.&nbsp; In my search for help, I have repeatedly heard, "well, they can't just put you out on the streets," as well as every type of useless suggestion imaginable.&nbsp; NO ONE KNOWS OR UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS NO HELP AVAILABLE!&nbsp; They truly believe that if I just ask for help or put enough effort into it, I will find housing.&nbsp; People believe that families are homeless because they WANT to be, or just don't want to put the time and effort into finding housing.</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>My income is $548 per month from SSI (I have Crohn's disease) and $700 from child support.&nbsp; With a chronic disease, I will die if I have to live in the cold in a tent.&nbsp; I am terrified my children will be taken from me.&nbsp; My children are terrified.</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>I am an educated, responsible, single mother with no family other than my children.&nbsp; My oldest some, 22, is putting himself through college with no help as well as supporting himself.&nbsp; He maintains a 4.0 (that's straight A's) grade average.&nbsp; My 20-year-old daughter was promoted to department manager at the grocery store where she works.&nbsp; It's the first time they have ever given a part-timer a managerial position.&nbsp; She also supports herself.&nbsp; My 18-year-old fixes computers and won a community service award.&nbsp; My children are good, caring, intelligent people who must constantly go without their basic human needs being met.&nbsp; We are always hungry, ($308 in Food Stamps does not feed five growing boys).&nbsp; I eat as little as possible.&nbsp; Our boiler and hot water heater do not work.&nbsp; The landlord won't fix them and our only source of heat is a wood stove and space heaters.&nbsp; We're almost always cold.&nbsp; My kids can't do anything that their friends do:&nbsp; they can't go to birthday parties (I can't afford presents) and anything thst costs money is not an option.&nbsp; I have cavities in all my teeth and can't possibly afford dental care.</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>None of us smokes, drinks, uses drugs, has ever been in trouble with the law or in any way is a detriment to society.&nbsp; Yet, we must live in the most deplorable conditions and now we are just a few weeks away from becoming homeless. I've written to our state senator, again no help from that end.&nbsp; No help from anybody!&nbsp; What should we do?&nbsp; Why does&nbsp;it seem&nbsp;nobody cares?&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>I just found out today that&nbsp;I can ask for a "stay&nbsp;of execution" (if it's not too late).&nbsp;It was only by a miracle that I got this information, nobody at the courthouse was willing to tell me, I can't afford an attorney.&nbsp; No one seems to care or want to give me any advice.&nbsp; Strangely enough it seems that the whole system is quite content to ignore our needs completely.</FONT></P>
<P style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><FONT size=2 face=Serif>If you have any ideas or suggestions, we sure could use them; otherwise, you could keep us in your prayers.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
